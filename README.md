# Speech Recognition

Speech recognition is an application of neural networks that has had several successes in the recent times and allowed for its uses in commercial applications. In this project, I aim to improve upon existing architectures.

One way I plan to this is by replacing the filter bank used in [1] with a convolutional network. I hope that this replacement will get us filters that better optimised for task.

# Data

I will be using the TIMIT dataset [2] as it is the one used by [1]. This would make the comparasion between my and their results more valid.
